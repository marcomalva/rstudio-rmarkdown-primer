# rstudio-rmarkdown-primer
Primer for creating R Markdown documents with RStudio

This is very much work in progress and also a personal but not private knowledge base.

Those new to RStudio might want to read [getting-started.md](./getting-started.md).

If you want to check your RStudio setup open [helloWorld.Rmd](./helloWorld.Rmd) and "knit" it.

New RMarkdown documents focus on a topic and are placed under a topic specific sub-folder under the `topic` folder.
TBD: List of topics w/ references to each document, ideally auto-generated or auto-modified.

## Setup

### RStudio Setup

I am running RStudio as a `docker/podman` container:

- run an isolated sandbox: [rocker-getting-started-sanboxed.md](hello-world/rocker-getting-started-sanboxed.md)
- run a reusable installation: [getting-started.md](./getting-started.md)

Until a docker/podman container is created see also: [rstudio-mounted-install-pkg.md[(./rstudio-mounted-install-pkg.md).

As for further reading on launching RStudio in Docker, see also:
